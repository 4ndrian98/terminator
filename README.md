**terminator** is an ai-first cross-platform ui automation library for rust, designed to interact with native gui applications on windows and macos using a playwright-like api.

it provides a unified api to find and control ui elements like buttons, text fields, windows, and more. because it uses os-level accessibility apis, it is **100x faster and more reliable** for ai agents than vision-based approaches.

> **Note:** while we support macos and windows, we are currently focusing development efforts on windows.

## documentation

for detailed information on features, installation, usage, and the api, please visit the **[official documentation](https://docs.screenpi.pe/terminator/introduction)**.

## quick start

1.  **clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mediar-ai/terminator
    cd terminator
    ```
2.  **download & unzip the server (windows cli):**
    *   use `Invoke-WebRequest` (or `curl` alias if available) to download the latest windows server release:
    ```powershell
    # PowerShell 5.1+ (comes with Windows)
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/mediar-ai/terminator/releases/latest/download/terminator-server-windows-x86_64.zip -OutFile terminator-server-windows-x86_64.zip

    # If you have actual curl installed (e.g., via Git Bash or manually), you can use:
    # curl -L -o terminator-server-windows-x86_64.zip https://github.com/mediar-ai/terminator/releases/latest/download/terminator-server-windows-x86_64.zip
    ```
    *   unzip the archive (using built-in powershell command):
    ```powershell
    Expand-Archive -Path terminator-server-windows-x86_64.zip -DestinationPath .\server_release
    # Or using tar if available:
    # mkdir server_release
    # tar -xzf terminator-server-windows-x86_64.zip -C server_release
    ```
3.  **run the server:**
    *   navigate to where you unzipped the server:
    ```bash
    cd server_release
    ```
    *   run the server:
    ```bash
    ./server.exe --debug
    ```
4.  **run an example client (in another terminal):**
    ```bash
    # make sure node.js/bun is installed
    cd examples # navigate back to the examples directory in the cloned repo
    npm i # or bun/yarn
    npx tsx client_example.ts
    # or python:
    python client_example.py
    ```
