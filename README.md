**terminator** is an ai-first cross-platform ui automation library for rust, designed to interact with native gui applications on windows and macos using a playwright-like api.

it provides a unified api to find and control ui elements like buttons, text fields, windows, and more. because it uses os-level accessibility apis, it is **100x faster and more reliable** for ai agents than vision-based approaches.

> **Note:** while we support macos and windows, we are currently focusing development efforts on windows.

## documentation

for detailed information on features, installation, usage, and the api, please visit the **[official documentation](https://docs.screenpi.pe/terminator/introduction)**.
