- **Agentic Workflows:** Designed specifically for agentic AI workflows.
- **Playwright-style API:** Offers a familiar and powerful API for developers.
- **Windows First:** Prioritizes Windows platform development and support.

## Use Cases:
- PDF-to-form autofill
- End-to-end application automation
- Embedded copilots

## Technical Highlights:
- **Performance:** Optimized for speed and reliability.
- **Deep GUI Introspection:** Allows for detailed understanding and manipulation of UI elements.
- **Modularity:** Code is structured in a modular fashion.
- **Asynchronous:** Built with async capabilities for efficient operation.
- **Integration-Friendly:** Designed for easy integration with LLM agents and external SDKs (e.g., Vercel AI).

## Core Focus:
The primary goal is to provide a fast, reliable, and deeply introspective UI automation engine, particularly for Windows applications, enabling advanced AI-driven automation tasks.
